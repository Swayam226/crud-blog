## Security & Authorization

* Environment variables ensure sensitive data (Mongo URI, Admin Secret) remains confidential.
* Input sanitization (`sanitize-html`) is applied to all post content to prevent **XSS attacks**.

## Folder Structure (Simplified)

```
/pages
  /api
    posts/[slug].js       // GET, PUT, DELETE post
    posts/create.js        // POST create new post
  admin
    index.js               // My Dashboard (admin)
    create.js              // Create Post page
    edit/[slug].js         // Edit Post page
  blog
    [slug].js              // Public blog post page
  index.js                 // Landing page
/components
  Header.js
  Footer.js
/lib
  dbConnect.js
/models
  Post.js
```

## Deployment (Vercel)

1. Pushed the complete codebase to **GitHub**.
2. Imported the repository into **Vercel**.
3. Set the following Environment Variables in Vercel:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
ADMIN_SECRET=your_admin_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_SECRET=your_admin_secret_key
```

4. Deployed the app ‚ûî Vercel auto-detects Next.js.
